# Hello World

## What this blog is about

I (aim to) post weekly updates on everything I've learnt in the past week, from readings to courses I'm currently enrolled in. 

Right now, I'm taking two courses:

1. fast.ai
2. Programming Languages

There'll be plenty to talk about and reflect upon, so stay tuned!

Also, I need to practice writing, so whenever I feel the need to, I'll post some random rantings/thoughts here as well.

## Chapters 1 to 3 - fast.ai

This course really starts off strong, with me already having deployed a deep learning models to recognize images as an Elixir web application. But it hasn't started getting down to into the weeds - so far, all I've gotten is a birds eye view of the capabilities of deep learning and a taste of what it can do.

I really like that it constantly emphasizes the importance of actually doing deep learning - finding problems, analysing how we can apply deep learning and actually doing it! This is really valuable in two ways:

1. You get to immediately apply and practice what you've just learnt 
2. You get a sense of what you still don't know yet

As a beginner's project, perhaps I'm going to test out deep learning's capabilities in transcribing heavily distorted audio, as I often hear over maritime radio transmissions. Also perhaps one for malay/indonesian/Chinese as we hear those languages pretty often too.

## Chapter 3

This chapter is all about data ethics - which I think of as a process of figuring out what's right and what's wrong based on the consequences of an action. The field of data ethics is really broad, so the chapter just delves into some of the most actionable and relevant parts, which still offers plenty of food for thought:

- Is there room for *recourse* in the application of deep learning?
- How can we avoid *positive feedback loops* in deep learning models?
- How should we account for *bias*?

## Programming Languages

I've really learnt a lot from this coursera MOOC, and yes it's quite difficult at times but the insights and learning points are so worth it. You get to see how programming languages are really related to each other, what are and the reasons for the design decisions they make, and code a bunch in interesting languages as well. 

The course has a heavy focus on functional programming for the first two sections, and you get to see the benefits and quirks of this very underemphasised programming paradigm in action. In many ways functional programming brought many ideas that were too advanced for its time, including:

1. Anonymous functions
2. Pattern matching
3. Closures

And many other features that are a joy to use. 

![Python 3.10: Pattern matching](/images/pyth10aa.jpg "it's coming...")

But what I like most about this course is that it teaches you to stop whining about syntax and to start focusing on semantics and idioms, which are where the meat of any programming languages lie.
